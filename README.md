# Acorn

A toy language made to learn some langauge concepts and test some ideas.

Language inspiration from c, zig, rust, (maybe more subconsciously?)

### Credits
- Zig compiler for some internal concepts

### Note

The language and compiler are both absolutely incomplete, and likely will not reach completion. The compiler
is somewhat hacked together for development speed, and has some known memory leaks as well as a lot of crash
points for unimplemented behavior.

Tests can be found in the `test` directory, but are largely for the parser at the moment.
