// Second implementation phase
//  - Introduction of boolean type (true/false literals, represented as i1)
//  - New operators: && || == != > < >= <=
//  - New prefix ! (logical not - only on boolean type)
true
false

// Notes
// - Still only executing a single expression
// - Still just two types (bool(i1) and int(i64))
